# State/Target params:.
#
# wrap_probabilities: probabilities of wrapping around to "dewind" the system. Must be sorted ascending by wind_req.
#
# wind_req: minimum number of winds required to take effect
# soft_limit: If the |target - state| is greater than this *in the direction of winds,* then the robot will run in the
#             dewind direction at probability given by probability
# probability: probability of dewinding if soft_limit is satisfied
# hard_limit: after this, robot is guaranteed to dewind
#
# Note: angles are given in degrees.
